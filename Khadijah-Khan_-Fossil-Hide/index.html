                    As their presence increasing around Atlanta and beyond, their website needed an
                    overhaul to increase direct sales and brand awareness. Our team chose to redesign
                    the Fossil & Hide website to help this small business achieve their career goals

                    Our research showed that Fossil & Hide’s website wasn’t maximizing its opportunity to
                    provide an effortless shopping experience nor exhibit their bold style. During our
                    research of shoppers’ jewelry and fashion preferences, we discovered just how
                    significant an impact a piece of jewelry can have not only on one’s wardrobe but
                    also on one’s state of mind and sense of self

                    Therefore, we believe that to better sell the uniqueness and exclusivity of a jewelry
                    statement piece we need to highlight each piece’s story, and that we might be able
                    to help Fossil & Hide if we speak more directly to the thought, time, and effort
                    they put into their work. We might do this by showcasing the jewelers performing
                    their craft, offering more content for each item page, and limiting the amount of
                    images per page so that the photographs become the minimalist statement pieces for
                    the webpage just as their jewelry is meant to be for their customers. Doing this
                    will allow our product to elevate the Fossil & Hide brand and allow for an increase
                    of demand and reputation.

                    defined the style, look, and feel of the website. The coding portion was led by Nathaniel who helped
                    bring the design to life.

                    The implementation of a business canvas model replenished a deeper understanding of the stakeholders
                    of Fossil & Hide. As we approached the redesign of the eCommerce experience, it was essential to
                    utilize the diffeent channels that currently brought consumers to the website. Social media and word of mouth
                    played a major role of building the brand. Most of their purchases were completed through Instagram. We wanted to
                    shift that form of purchase to their main website. It was crucial to pull our social media audience and to
                    build a bridge between both platforms.</p>
